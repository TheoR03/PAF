# Projects

This project was designed to solve the challenge ISIC: https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/. 
The purpose is to take skin lesion and identify the melanomas thanks to ML, after preprocessing steps of segmentation and feature extraction.
We also implemented a CNN that solved that challenge.
